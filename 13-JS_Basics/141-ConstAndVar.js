// Const - works just like let, except you cannot change the value
// good for storing things we know won't change

const hens = 4;
// hens = 20;
console.log(hens);

const age = 17;
// age = age + 1; assignment to constant variable
console.log(age);

// Const is good for storing things we know won't change

const feetMile = 5280;

// var - old way to make variables - these days no really reason to use it
