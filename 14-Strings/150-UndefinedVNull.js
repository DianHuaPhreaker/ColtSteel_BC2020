// Undefined v Null
// Both primitive values

// Null - intentional absence of any value. Null must be assigned. It's something we set

// Undefined - variables that do not have an assigned value are undefined.
// Undefined is something is not there. Something we DON'T assign ourselves

console.log("hello".indexOf[99]); // undefined
// undefined is JS way to say IDK

// Null is intentional lack of value. Concept of nothing.

let loggedInUser = null;
console.log(loggedInUser); // null

loggedInUser = "Bill Gates";

console.log(loggedInUser);
